   <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>

   <h4>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
     
   <p id="demo">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

   <h4>Where does it come from?</h4>
  
   <p id="demo1">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<br>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,<br> and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<br> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.<br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.<br> The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br><br>
   The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.<br> Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,<br> accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

   <h4>Why do we use it?</h4>
  
   <p id="demo2">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,<br> as opposed to using 'Content here, content here' making it look like readable English.<br> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,<br> and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.<br> Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

   </button-box>
     
   <h4>Where can I get some?</h4>
  
   <p id="demo3">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,<br> but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,<br> or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.<br> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<br> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,<br> making this the first true generator on the Internet.<br> It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,<br> to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.<br> The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
